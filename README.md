## About Me
I am from Chicago, IL and went to Rhodes College in Memphis, TN for my bachelor's in Neuroscience! Currently I'm a second-year Neuroscience PhD student in the Brain Institute and I enjoy writing little Python scripts to make my research easier (see: https://github.com/gabbyblah/ymazeseq).

## My Research
I am a member of the Zwezdaryk & Liz Labs in the SOM. We study infectious etiology of Alzheimer's Disease specifically examining intermittent cytomegalovirus infections across the lifetime in mice!

## Fun Fact
I have been using Python for about three years now but I have never taken a formal class on coding - just hours of trial and error :).
